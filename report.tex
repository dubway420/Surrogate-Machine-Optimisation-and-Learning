I would like to thank my supervisor, Tingting Mu, who spent many patient hours with me throughout my journey towards becoming a researcher. I'd also like to thank many other members of the faculty for their help and support over the past four years, including Professor Gavin Brown, Professor Bijan Parsia, Dr Danny Wood, Charlie Reynolds, Dr Andrew Webb, Dr Alessio Sarullo and Dr Mike Phuycharoen.

I'd also like to acknowledge the assistance
given by Research IT and the use of the Computational
Shared Facility at The University of Manchester.

Finally I'd like to thank my mother Tula Jones and my late father Tudor Jones for their love and unending support, not only during my PhD but my whole life.
