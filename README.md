# Parmec_AGR_ML_Surrogate

Framework for the development of machine learning surrogate model

Packages are available for data generation/labelling, model design/development, evaluation and testing.

## Set-up and Dataset

For detailed instructions on set up and use, see the [Wiki](https://gitlab.cs.man.ac.uk/q59494hj/parmec_agr_ml_surrogate/wikis/Tutorial:-Getting-Started).

Begin by cloning this repository then downloading the [dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/6967536) and place it within the repository folder. You nominally need the following files:

* dataset_cases.pkl
* test_set_cases.pkl
* Y_dataset_C159_160_L11_12_T48_R1_all_T.npy
* Y_test_set_C159_160_L11_12_T48_R1_all_T.npy

These files includes inputs and outputs for both training and testing. 

## Model Development

The main package files are located within [machine_learning](/machine_learning)
