Programme files for a machine learning surrogate model for the Parmec Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor model

Welcome to this repository. 

**Excel/ Visual Basic**
The repo contains a modified Excel spreadsheet (as generated by Atkins). This sheet generates 3D arrays which represent the brick structure of the core. 
The spreadsheet randomly places cracks within the 3D strucutre.  The spreadsheet will be modified from the original: the creation of instances and output 
files will be automated according to user defined seeds. The repository will contain the files generated by the spreadsheet.
